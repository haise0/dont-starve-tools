## The Gist of Things

I wanted a GUI tool that works. I've seen quite a few things, and I have indeed seen the original tools by Steam, but it just sucks not having it all in one place.

Forked for usage in conjunction with the continuation of [DSTED's DSTEd-C](https://github.com/DST-Tools/DSTEd/), renamed to [Klein](https://github.com/haise0/Klein-DST/), until I can integrate it into the Klein project and provide fuller functionality (as Klein cannot yet convert PNGs to .TEX files at the moment).

Contribution is more than welcome, so please make a pull request for fixes/functionality or submit an issue if you're having problems and can't figure it out yourself.
